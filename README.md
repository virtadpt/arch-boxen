==========

This is a repository of scripts I use to automate the construction of various Arch Linux machines.  I'll eventually turn these into packer.io scripts or something.  Right now, they're just shell scripts that I run to do stuff.  If there are any config file changes I'll put them into fakeroots.

* echopraxia - Work laptop.
* mad-max - Any number of bootable flash drives I have that run Arch.  I build them for use on specific field assignments, copy new files off, and then destroy the drives because I can't trust them anymore.
* windbringer - Personal laptop.
* xbmc - Any number of bootable flash drives I build that run XBMC.
